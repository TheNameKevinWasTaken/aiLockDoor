Facial Recognition Door lock Project

In this project, I've used Haar Cascade object detection in a video stream.

Haar Cascase theory:
  Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective
  object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper,
  "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001. It
  is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a
  lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.
  Initially, the algorithm uses a lot of positive images (images of faces) and negative
  images (images without faces) to train the classifier.


Firebase database is being used to save the images of faces that must be recognized.
Along with that, an unique id is created every time a new image is uploaded to the db.
