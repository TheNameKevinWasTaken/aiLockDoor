Facial Recognition Door lock Project

In this project, I've used Haar Cascade object detection in a video stream.

Haar Cascade theory:
  Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective
  object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper,
  "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001. It
  is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a
  lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.
  Initially, the algorithm uses a lot of positive images (images of faces) and negative
  images (images without faces) to train the classifier.

Due to the limitation of Raspberry Pi memory, CNN (Computational Neural Network) face detector
can't be used. Another option is to HOG (histogram of oriented gradients) but very slow on Pi.
Thus, HC is used to get at least 1-3 FPS.
